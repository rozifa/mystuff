More code isn't better

Switches the focus from porblem sovling
to writing code.
	Code is used to solve problems. 
	Can you explain it in a way that is
	understadable. 
		What is the problem?

Adding novice "coders" to the workforce
is assumed to be good. It isn't.

Focus on salary
	Learning a quick and easy skill to make money
		This isn't true.
			The hard part is identifying a problem and coming up with a logical solution. Code is just used as a tool to execute your plan. 

The only reason we use code is because its efficent. 

Counter Arguments Addressed 

But doesn't it expose kids to code and generate an interest?

	I would argue that the curiosity and method of thinking that causes one to 
	explore and become self interested in coding is necassary to code properly.
		Basically, if you were meant to code, you would've already figured it out on your own.

Doesn't it teach them a tool that they can later use to solve problems?
	
	The tool is useless wihtout context. You don't understand how computers solve problems. And you don't understand how to solve problems in the first place. 

	You need to understand how to approach problems.

The first classes you take in computer science aren't about the syntax or "grammar" of coding, its conventions, or implementing it.
They are about algorythms and data scturctures. 
	They are about logic and problem solving
	And they all depend on math and reasoning.
